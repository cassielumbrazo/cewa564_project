### The Problem:
* SUMMA (the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives) is a integrated snow hydrology model written in Fortran. As such, PySUMMA was developed as a python wrapper to the compiled Fortran code. This workgroup will explore a variety of fundamental yet important science questions relating to the snowpack energy balance.
